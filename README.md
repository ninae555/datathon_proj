# Datathon Project
## Water Purity prediction

Clean and safe drinking water is vital for life, yet, many people around the world face water scarcity and contamination. The World Health Organization has found that 2.1 billion people throughout the world lack access to safe drinking water(WHO, 2023). How can we ensure that everyone has access to drinkable water?

A major issue for clean water access is sanitation. 32% of the world population lack sanitation facilities. This exposes them to serious health risks like diarrhea, cholera, dysentery, typhoid, and polio as it spreads through contaminated water. It is estimated that 485,00 people die due to diarrhoeal deaths each year. Moreover, water is essential for hygiene. It can prevent not only diarrheal diseases but also respiratory infections and tropical diseases (WHO, 2023).

Microbial contamination is not the only risk. As human population grows and climate change develops, harmful chemicals are making their way into the water supply. Chemicals like arsenic, fluoride, and nitrate are harmful for health. Emerging contaminants such as pharmaceuticals, pesticides, PFASs, and microplastics are also increasing in concern (CDC, 2020). Safe drinking water is not only a health issue but also an environmental, economic, and social one. Clean water supports various sectors such as manufacturing, farming, tourism, recreation, and energy (EPA,2023).

We need effective methods to assess and predict water quality based on its features. This is what we aim to complish with our project. We will examine the factors that affect water quality and build models to predict water potability.

We hope that by joining this datathon, we can help protect water resources, improve water quality, and ultimately safeguard the health and well-being of billions of people around the world.
